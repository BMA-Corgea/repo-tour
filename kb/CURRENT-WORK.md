# repo-tour — CURRENT WORK

Present tense only. Updated at EVERY handoff (see the handoff procedure).
Target size: ~2 pages. The live edge is never pruned; the recent past keeps
~15 items or ~30 days, one line each with the WHY; anything older is dropped
here and found via the reference table below.

## Live edge

<!-- What is in motion right now: one line per active ticket/effort —
     what, why, where it stands, what is next. Never pruned while live. -->

- **T-1** (feature) — The digest engine: deterministic extraction with rollup and incremental re-dige… — verify
  `T-1-digest-engine` (4 commits, 19 tests green). Sitting at **auto-review**, deliberately
  not advanced: acceptance criteria 5 (rollup) and 6 (incremental driver) are still
  unbuilt, so the ticket must not drift toward `accept`. **Next:** build stage 5 (rollup)
  and the diff-driven incremental digest, then advance.

## Waiting on

<!-- Holds: "waiting at <gate> on <keyholder> since <date>, ping sent to
     <channel>" — no session should discover a hold by archaeology (ruling 24). -->

- **Nothing is blocking.** Two things are Evan's to decide when he wants them, neither
  urgent and neither blocking the build:
  - the `merge` gate on T-1 is next after auto-review; its policy is `unattended`, so it
    does not require him — but partial work should not land silently, so it is being held
    until criteria 5 and 6 are built.
  - `github.com/BMA-Corgea/repo-tour` exists and is empty. No git remote is configured in
    this working tree. Wiring it and pushing is his call; nothing needs it yet.

## Recent past (~15 items / ~30 days)

<!-- One line per completed item, WITH the why. Newest first. Prune from the
     bottom; the permanent record lives in tickets, events.jsonl, and wiki. -->

- **2026-08-26** — Criterion 8 built: self-contained HTML digest view (`src/view.ts`).
  Why: criteria 1–7 prove the machinery, but only a human reading a page can judge whether
  the digest is any good. Self-containment is enforced by test, not intent.
- **2026-08-26** — auto-review finding fixed, not waived: `inventory()` read whole files
  into memory to hash them. Why it mattered: large repos are the entire target. Now
  chunk-hashed; verified identical output on GUTS.
- **2026-08-26** — Stages 1–3 built (inventory, extract, rank) in Node + TypeScript.
  Why this shape: ordering is the cost-control mechanism — every free, exact stage runs
  first so the paid stage only ever reads what survived.
- **2026-08-26** — Language decided: **Node + TypeScript** with `web-tree-sitter`, by Evan.
  Why: the engine and the tour UI talk constantly; Python would put a serialization seam
  through the middle of the product. Cost accepted: the only non-Python repo in the estate.
- **2026-08-26** — Onboarding closed out (3 of 4 goals; `about` left open by choice).
  Why it looked unstarted: session 1 captured every answer into the transcript but never
  marked the steps, so the board read 0/4 when it was really 3/4.
- **2026-08-25** — T-1 spec approved by Evan (GA-1), `spec_ready` cleared.

| Looking for... | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Any ticket's full journey | its ticket file (by id/slug) and its handoff in `.autodev/handoffs/` |
| The event-by-event record | `events.jsonl` (append-only, forever) |
| Durable lessons and decisions | `kb/wiki/` |
| What the code looks like now | `kb/CODE-MAP.md` |
| Why the language is Node | `kb/wiki/decision-implementation-language.md` |
| What T-1's build actually proved | `.autodev/reports/T-1-plan.md` (per-criterion status) |
